# 🚔 Robbery Detection System using YOLO

## **📌 Overview**

The Robbery Detection System is an AI-powered security solution that utilizes YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection and motion tracking to identify potential threats in surveillance footage. The system continuously analyzes video feeds, detects unusual motion, and identifies suspicious individuals within a restricted area. Upon detection, it automatically triggers real-time alerts via email to notify security personnel or authorities, ensuring a proactive response to potential incidents.

This system is designed for banks, retail stores, warehouses, and home security, providing an efficient, automated, and customizable surveillance solution.


## **🔥 Features**

✔️ Real-time Motion Detection – Tracks movement using OpenCV and detects anomalies.

✔️ AI-powered Object Detection – Uses the YOLOv5 model to identify people and other relevant objects.

✔️ Automated Email Alerts – Instantly sends notifications when unusual motion or unauthorized individuals are detected.

✔️ Dynamic Video Analysis – Processes live or recorded footage with high accuracy.

✔️ Customizable Sensitivity Settings – Adjusts motion detection and alert thresholds based on the environment.

✔️ Event-based Video Recording – Saves analyzed footage for later review and security audits.

✔️ Scalable & Lightweight – Can be deployed on CCTV systems, Raspberry Pi, or cloud-based surveillance setups.


## **🛠️ Technologies Used**

Python (OpenCV, NumPy, smtplib)

YOLOv5 (Object detection model)

SMTP (Gmail) (For email alerts)

Computer Vision (Motion tracking, object recognition)

## **📊 Future Enhancements**

1. Integration with Twilio SMS API for mobile notifications.

2. Cloud storage for logging security events and remote monitoring.

3. Live CCTV integration for 24/7 surveillance.

## **🚀 Potential Use Cases**

✔️ Bank Security – Prevent ATM theft and unauthorized access.

✔️ Retail Stores – Identify shoplifting activities.

✔️ Warehouses – Monitor restricted storage areas.

✔️ Home Security – Detect intruders and trespassers.
